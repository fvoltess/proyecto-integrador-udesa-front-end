# Chute â€“ Movie & Series Explorer

**Chute** is a front-end web application that allows users to explore movies and TV series using data from the [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/). Users can search by title or genre, view top-rated and popular titles, and see detailed pages for each item.

This project was developed as part of the final assignment for the **Front-End Technologies** course at the **University of San AndrÃ©s**.
